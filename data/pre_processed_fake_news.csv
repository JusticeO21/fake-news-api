buried in trump s bonkers interview with new york times reporters maggie haberman and glenn thrush is this outrageous exchange trump claims happened recentlytrump us representative elijah cummings was in my office and he said  you will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country haberman reallytrump and then he went out and i watched him on television yesterday and i said  was that the same man which  would have been odd considering cummings a fiery democratic congressman has been one of trump s most intense critics he s very public about it cummings has been outspoken about trump s disturbing connections to russia the gop s botched attempts to cover those connections up and has repeatedly demanded trump divest himself of his numerous conflicts of interest he hardly sounds like a person who has looked at trump s trainwreck first three months in office and concluded that he deserves to be up on mount rushmoreone theory was that trump flatly lied always a possibility   trump is a pathological liar another suggested by writer jamelle bouie is that trump mixed up two black men conflating cummings with some other guy another strong possibility   trump has shown a complete lack of interest in the lives of black americansfortunately cummings came in to provide the real answer trump took a criticism cummings has made to his face and filtered it through his unchecked narcissism here s how cummings describes the meeting trump said was about praising him during my meeting with the president and on several occasions since then i have said repeatedly that he could be a great president if   if   he takes steps to truly represent all americans rather than continuing on the divisive and harmful path he is currently on note the jab that trump completely missed if trump stops being  divisive and harmful  he could someday be a great president so far he has not done so hasn t even tried as if to underscore how little trump has tried to stop being divisive in the same interview he defended bill o reilly for sexually harassing women at fox newsunintentionally trump s bizarre retelling of what went down during his meeting with cummings exemplifies the warped way trump sees the world a criticism turns into praise stripping away all context in the process it may explain for example why trump seems to genuinely believe he saw muslim americans celebrating on 911 his ego filters everything facts get distorted and retooled for his own agendathe fact that we have a president who does not seem to understand the difference between reality and the fantasy world that exists in his head is a recipe for disaster if meetings with a congressman get this distorted what other delusions is trump living infeatured image via win mcnameegetty images,Fake News

judge panel  all democratic appointees  did not address whether it was unconstitutional discrimination against muslims a second court the richmond virginiabased 4th us circuit court of appeals on may 25 upheld a maryland judges ruling that also blocked trumps 90day ban on travelers from libya iran somalia sudan syria and yemen  the 4th circuit had ruled that the ban which replaced an earlier jan 27 one also blocked by the courts drips with religious intolerance animus and discrimination aimed at muslims the 9th circuit largely left in place a nationwide injunction by judge derrick watson that stopped parts of the order which trump said was urgently needed to prevent terrorism in the united states that ruling came in a lawsuit challenging the order brought by the state of hawaii which stated the ban would harm its universities and tourism industry even before mondays ruling the case was on the fast track to the supreme court where the administration on june 1 filed an emergency request seeking to reinstate the order and hear its appeal of the 4th circuit ruling the supreme court could act on the administrations request as soon as this week trump has been on the losing side in all four court rulings on the march order white house spokesman sean spicer said the administration is reviewing mondays decision and expressed continued confidence that the order is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the supreme court i think we can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the united states and committing acts of bloodshed and violence spicer told a briefing the 9th circuit upheld the block on trumps threemonth travel ban for the six countries and fourmonth suspension of all refugee admissions but the court pared back part of watsons injunction in order to allow the government to conduct internal reviews on vetting procedures for these travelers the administration said the travel ban was needed to allow time to implement stronger vetting measures although it has already rolled out some new requirements not blocked by courts including additional questions for visa applicants rather than focusing on trump campaign statements as the virginiabased court did the 9th circuit said the language in the executive order itself did not make a rational case for why a travel ban was needed the order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality the court wrote referring the combined populations of the six countries  under immigration law the administration was required to make findings that entry of the people in question would be detrimental to the united states but failed to do so the court said stephen vladeck a professor at university of texas school of law said the 9th circuit provided an easier path for the supreme court to keep the travel ban on hold because it avoided entirely the controversy over trumps campaign statements  it provides a very attractive way to leave the injunction in place without setting broader doctrinal rules about which they may have pause vladeck said trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states monday was the deadline for the bans challengers to respond to the administrations request that the order be allowed to go into effect the american civil liberties union which represents people challenging the ban in the separate maryland suit handled by the 4th circuit filed court papers urging the court not to take up the case saying the order will become moot on wednesday 90 days from when trump issued it lawyers for hawaii called the order a thinly veiled muslim ban trumps earlier jan 27 order also included iraq among the countries targeted and a total ban on refugees from syria the march order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban but was blocked before it could go into effect on march 16 the suits by hawaii and the maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the constitutions first amendment that prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion hawaiis court papers mentioned a series of trump twitter posts on june 5 trump described the order as a watered down politically correct version of his original one ,Factual News

this guy just wants everyone deadpastor steven anderson of faithful word baptist church in arizona just does not know how to shut his mouththe day after the orlando mass shooting anderson praised the 49 murders and called upon the government to execute all gay people across the nationjust this past sunday anderson repeated his call to execute gay people but added a call to purge any christians who supports the lgbt communityand now anderson is calling for reinstating the death penalty against anyone who is tried and convicted of committing adultery adultery is not a crime in the united states but anderson called for punishing those who commit it with death in a written manifesto on his blog last week when someone says that homosexuality is worthy of death according to the bible people inevitably will bring up other sins that were also punishable by death in the old testament  he wrote  they think they are somehow catching us in hypocrisy but the truth is bible believing christians do agree with those other old testament penalties as well we just need to realize that god s laws were the law of the land in those days today adultery is not punishable by law in the united states but it should be just as he did when he called for executing gay people anderson laid out his vision of a  righteous government  presumably made up of conservative  christians  who will shred the constitution and replace it with the bible and said such a government would make adultery a capital crime worthy of arrest and death if convicted by what one can only imagine would be a kangaroo court this anderson says is the way he would prevent adultery and divorceyes a righteous government would implement the death penalty for those tried and convicted of adultery we all know normal people who have unfortunately committed this grievous sin and of course we wouldn t want them to die for it if we were to somehow vote in a law making adultery illegal it would not be retroactive it would be the law going forward and adultery rates would plummet and so would divorce rates think about it though do you really think as many people commit adultery in societies where it is punishable by death of course not so you can relax about your aunt trudy who cheated on her husband thirty years ago if aunt trudy had lived in a society that enforced the death penalty for adultery chances are she would never have committed that sin in the first placeindeed other nations in the world do in fact punish adulterers with death there s only one problemas it turns out punishing adultery by execution is something that occurs today mostly under islamic law conservatives like anderson would refer to this as  sharia law  and usually it overwhelmingly punishes women especially women who have been rapedaccording to the weekthe un has issued numerous calls to governments to repeal laws that criminalise adultery arguing that they are predominantly used to discriminate against women  provisions in penal codes often do not treat women and men equally and establish harsher rules and sanctions for women  writes human rights expert frances radaycountries governed by islamic law including saudi arabia pakistan and somalia all strictly prohibit  zina  or  fornication outside marriage  prosecutions are common and punishment can include fines arbitrary detention imprisonment flogging and in extreme cases the death penalty women are overwhelmingly targetedhuman rights organisations argue that in several muslim nations adultery laws are often used against women who have been raped under such legislation the burden of proof is on the woman to provide evidence that she was raped or be prosecuted for adulteryin short what anderson is proposing is a barbaric practice that is mostly practiced in countries that are governed by some form of sharia law and is used primarily to punish womenbasically he is calling for the united states to be governed by christian sharia law you know the same sharia law that conservatives freak out about and pass laws againstanderson concluded his  sermon  by claiming that the death penalty deters crime and shrugged at the notion that people don t want their loved ones executed just because they had an extramarital affairin countries where adultery is still a capital crime it s not an everyday occurrence and usually ends up in the news just as capital punishment is a strong deterrent against murder it has the same effect on other crimestelling us that we would not want people we know and care about to be put to death is a straw man argument we don t want our friends and family to be convicted of murder either but they probably won t kill anyone so we don t worry about it when the children of israel committed adultery they knew the risk going inhowever it s worth noting that multiple studies by researchers have been unable to prove that the death penalty is a deterrent to crimethe bottom line is that is that anderson is a maniac who wants to bathe america in blood in order to create what he considers the perfect christian utopia millions upon millions of americans would be murdered in this endeavor if anderson had his way and that is precisely why conservative  christians  can never be allowed to have power in our governmentfeatured image screenshot,Fake News

loehr a professor at cornell university law school who specializes in immigration ultimately the case is likely to end up in the us supreme court legal experts said  the case is the first serious test of executive authority since trump became president on jan 20 and legal experts said there were three main issues at play for the judiciary  the broad questions in the case are whether the states have the right to challenge federal immigration laws how much power the court has to question the presidents national security decisions and if the order discriminates against muslims  washington state filed the original lawsuit claiming it was hurt by the ban when students and faculty from staterun universities and corporate employees were stranded overseas  trump administration lawyer august flentje argued at an appeals court hearing on tuesday that the states lack standing to sue the federal government over immigration law but his arguments were questioned by the judges  if the court decides the states are allowed to bring the case the next major question is about the limits of the presidents power  historically courts have been exceedingly deferential to governmental actions in the immigration area said jonathan adler a case western reserve university school of law professor though he added the way they carried it out understandably makes some people and perhaps some courts uneasy with applying the traditional rules  trump issued the order late on a friday and caused chaos at airports as officials struggled to quickly change procedures  at tuesdays hearing judge richard clifton an appointee of republican president george w bush and judge william canby an appointee of democratic president jimmy carter pushed the government to explain what would happen if trump simply decided to ban all muslims from entering the united states would anybody be able to challenge that canby asked  flentje emphasized that the order did not ban muslims he said the president made a determination about immigration policy based on a legitimate assessment of risk  the government has said its order is grounded in a law passed by congress that allows the president to suspend the entry of any class of aliens that he deems would be detrimental to the interests of the united states  when asked by the third judge  michelle friedland appointed by democrat barack obama  if that meant the presidents decisions are unreviewable flentje after a pause answered yes when pressed flentje acknowledged however that constitutional concerns had been raised about the order  one of the main concerns is allegations by the states civil rights groups some lawmakers and citizens that the order discriminates in violation of the constitutions first amendment which prohibits favoring one religion over another  the judges will have to decide whether to look exclusively at the actual text of the presidents order which does not mention any particular religion or consider outside comments by trump and his team to discern their intent  washington states attorney noah purcell told the hearing that even though the lawsuit is at an early stage the amount of evidence that trump intended to discriminate against muslims is remarkable it cited trumps campaign promises of a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states  in a tweet on monday night trump said the threat from radical islamic terrorism is very real urging the courts to act quickly  government lawyer flentje countered purcell by saying there was danger in second guessing trumps decisionmaking about us security based on some newspaper articles  clifton asked about statements on fox news by trump adviser rudolph giuliani former new york mayor and former prosecutor that trump had asked him to figure out how to make a muslim ban legal  do you deny that in fact the statements attributed to then candidate trump and to his political advisers and most recently mr giuliani clifton asked either those types of statements were made or not said clifton if they were made it is potential evidence  ,Factual News

term boost from the tax break critics said its wider business impact was unclear as was whether it is needed with the economy slowly but steadily growing and investment capital abundant moreover some said a fiveyear immediate expensing policy could set up a capital investment hangover in late 2022 or 2023 by shifting privatesector plant and equipment purchases into the five years covered and out of later years one outcome would be sure they said putting immediate expensing in place for the next five years would make it unavailable until 2022 to combat a possible future recession its hard to see how moving to full expensing except at the margin would produce the growth that theyre looking for from this provision said corporate tax analyst robert willens formerly an executive at kpmg and lehman brothers its also true that once you go to full expensing theres nothing more you can do particularly during a later downturn when you might really need to provide a jolt to the economy immediate expensing lets companies take a tax deduction for the full value of new plant and equipment upon purchase rather than stringing out deductions over several years under accelerated or normal depreciation schedules immediate expensing has been tried before but not for as long and at the maximum level proposed by trump his advisers and congressional republicans their plan faces months of debate in congress before it could become law it calls for immediate expensing for at least five years at an unprecedented level and urges congress to work out the details with a focus on helping small businesses that will be something that people have never seen before and it will be truly great trump said on friday at a national association of manufacturers event where his remarks were applauded by a roomful of business executives federal tax revenues would be slashed under trumps plan an estimate of immediate expensings revenue impact earlier this year was for a loss of 22 trillion over a 10year window according to the tax foundation a businessfocused group that supports making immediate expensing permanent not temporary scott hodge president of the foundation said permanent expensing is needed if trump wants to meaningfully boost economic growth the only way to get there is by having permanent immediate expensing for all capital investments not a shortterm policy that robs investment from the future only then do you get the longterm increase in investments that boost productivity wages and gdp hodge said louisiana republican senator bill cassidy told reporters on capitol hill on tuesday that full expensing could be quite effective for economic growth im favorably disposed but id like to see it in the context of everything else some tax experts questioned the need for expensing at all     while us economic growth has been sluggish there is little evidence that businesses are short on investment capital theres no sign that theres a shortage of capital available to business today  so is immediate expensing really necessary asked ed kleinbard a law professor at the university of southern california and former chief of staff of the us congresss joint committee on taxation the tax code has not been overhauled since 1986 under former president ronald reagan trumps plan is largely a set of tax cuts that is less ambitious than reagans sweeping package but the plan is politically important to the republicans after more than eight months in office trump has no major domestic policy achievement much is riding on the tax plan which the business community has eagerly awaited immediate expensing was put in place under former democratic president barack obama for qualified investments between september 2010 and january 2012 part of his recovery program after the deepest us recession in decades after 2012 immediate expensing was cut to 50 percent of new investment through 2017 it has been slated to decline in phases to 40 percent in 2018 and 30 percent in 2019 trumps plan would bring it back up to 100 percent through late 2022 investment firm morgan stanley questioned the impact of the immediate expensing proposal in a recent research note  we are not sure that this policy can drive incremental stimulus because the tax code has contained similar incentives since 2008 evidence shows that only 50 percent of companies elect to use bonus depreciation the firm said adding that the likeliest beneficiaries would be in the utilities telecoms materials and industrials sectors ,Factual News

checked his lie about supreme court history ted cruz showed no shame as he repeated the same line on sundaythe gop debate started off on saturday night with dickerson asked cruz about whether or not president obama should be able to name a successor to supreme court justice antonin scalia who died earlier that daycruz claimed that a supreme court nominee named by a lame duck president has not been confirmed by the senate in 80 years dickerson however pointed out that former president ronald reagan s nomination of justice anthony kennedy to the bench in 1987 was confirmed by the senate in 1988 the final year of reagan s presidency thus dickerson caught cruz lying which stunned the candidate into silence as the crowd booed the moderator for bringing up pesky factsduring an appearance on abc s this week the texas senator told george stephanopoulos the very same lie and then blamed democrats as the reason why kennedy was only confirmed in 1988 claiming that it would never have happened if they had just automatically confirmed universally despised nominee robert bork instead of rejecting him and his extremism george the senate has not confirmed a nominee that was named in the final year an election year in 80 years this is a lame duck president and by the way the only reason anthony kennedy was nominated that late is that democrats in the senate had gone after and defeated two previous nominees robert bork which set a new standard for partisan attacks on a nominee and doug ginsburg so it was the democrats that had dragged it out for many months to make it that late and right now the court is exquisitely balanced the fact is however that there is a process to supreme court nominations and confirmations many presidents have had their nominees rejected by the senate so it s not like reagan was the first to have a nominee fail to be confirmed the bottom line is that cruz is still wrong on his supreme court historybut cruz wasn t done upon being asked if he would filibuster anyone president obama nominates to fill scalia s seat cruz replied  absolutely  and said that the people should decide who fills the seat by electing the next president this should be a decision for the people george we ve got an election and you know democrats   i cannot wait to stand on that stage with hillary clinton or with bernie sanders and take the case to the people what vision of the supreme court do you want let the election decide it if the democrats want to replace this nominee they need to win the election here s the video via abc abc breaking news  latest news videosthis is a particularly hard argument to make since americans elected president obama for a full four year second term in 2012 by five million votes president obama has nearly a full year left in office so it is absolutely absurd not to mention an admission that republican will refuse to do their constitutional duty to suggest that president obama should force america to wait a full year or more before the supreme court is functioning with a full nine member bench again president obama earned the right to nominate a supreme court justice when he won the 2012 election ted cruz and his republican comrades need to get over it and do their damn jobs featured image via video screen capture,Fake News

terrorist forces occupied the eastern part of the city aleppo was home to one of the middle east s top cancer treatment centers alkindi hospital this is important because after mccain s secret trip to the aleppo area in may 2013 the very same  rebels  he was cavorting with and supplying weapons to   the  free syrian army  under the command of jabbat al nusra aka al qaeda in syria would later order the bombing on this cancer treatment hospitalprofessor tim anderson explains the destruction of al kindi hospital in december 2013 including the shameful spin applied after the fact by bbc and western mainstream mediain an orwellian revision of events the bbc 21 december 2013 reported the destruction of alkindi with the headline  syria rebels take back strategic hospital in aleppo  the introduction claimed the  massive suicide lorry bomb  had managed  to seize back a strategic ruined hospital occupied by assad loyalists  alkindi was said to have been  a disused building  and  according to an unconfirmed report 35 rebels died in the attack  in fact these  rebels  were a coalition of free syrian army and jabhat al nusra while the  assad loyalists  were the staff and security guards of a

service one hundred thousand or maybe five hundred thousand one million one day those figures will be recorded and we will have the answerthe other piece of us legislation currently on the table which republicans are desperate to pass is the 1trillion us infrastructure spending package juxtapose that scene next to the systematic destruction of syria s infrastructure by us coalition and idf airstrikes and destruction by proxy militant forces on the ground estimates for the cost to syria range from 180 billion to 275 million if the conflict continues past 2020 then these numbers could easily doublein spite of all this john mccain claims to have no regrets about the damage that he and his fellow war hawks have inflicted on syriathe cancer of conflictat the same time that political figures like barrack obama dutifully respect the official washington line on john mccain as the consummate  vietnam war hero  very few in the establishment would dare to criticize the powerful arizona senator for his central role in engineering instability and violent conflict in foreign countriesjohn mccain sneaks into syria illegally in may 2013 to meet with known terrorists promising them weapons and regime change by way us bombs would drop in the fall of 2013 americans should be reminded that more than any other single us official john mccain has been the driving force behind the training and arming of violent jihadist and terrorists fighting groups in syria and that those same terrorists have slaughtered tens of thousands of innocent civilians including women and children in syria and beyond   all sacrificed at the altar of a usled geopolitical power play in the middle east and in the name of israeli  security interests back in 2012 a delusional mccain along with another dotty war enthusiast connecticut senator joe liberman insisted that the us needed to arm the  rebels  in syria in order to  save lives  their statement read the bloodshed must be stopped and we should rule out no option that could help to save lives we must consider among other actions providing opposition groups inside syria both political and military with better means to organize their activities to care for the wounded and find safe haven to communicate securely to defend themselves and to fight back against assad s forces from the onset of hostilities in 2011 the boldfaced lie that mccain and partner lindsey graham have promulgated is that violent jihadists were nothing more than affable  moderate rebels  that piece of washington fiction has been widely discredited by nowlater on in 2015 mccain announced that the us should be supplying stinger missiles to the socalled  rebels  in syria we certainly did that in afghanistan after the russians invaded afghanistan we provided them with surfacetoair capability it d be nice to give people that we train and equip and send them to fight the ability to defend themselves that s one of the fundamental principles of warfare as i understand it  said mccainsoon after that statement thousands of usmade tow missiles were smuggled into syria and used by terrorists groups under the command umbrella of al nusrain her recent expos  for trud newspaper bulgarian journalist dilyana gaytandzhieva revealed the massive scale and scope of the illegal usnato weapons trafficking operation to arm thousands of terrorist fighters in syriadespite the overwhelming destruction in syria and the abject failure of his policies mccain has never given up on the policy of illegal weapons trafficking in syria just this week mccain chairman of the senate armed services committee openly protested against the trump administration s latest announcement to bring an end to the cia s failed program of illegally arming and training  antiassad  terrorists in syria rather than admitting what everyone else in the world seems to know already   that the us  train and equip  program has been a debacle   instead he feigns defiance while demonstrating a breathtaking level of ignorance by accusing the white house of being part of a russian conspiracy if these reports are true the administration is playing right into the hands of vladimir putin   making any concession to russia absent a broader strategy for syria is irresponsible and shortsighted when promoting their latest war mccain is normally part of a tandem act accompanied by his geomancing interest south carolina senator lindsey graham who arguably views the world through an even more deranged albeit binary comic book prism breaking syria apart from iran could be as important to containing a nuclear iran as sanctions if the syrian regime is replaced with another form of government that doesn t tie its future to the iranians the world is a better place like a world view gleaned straight from ian fleming s goldfingerin his seminal 2008 interview with mccain heading to the gop presidential nomination the atlantic magazine s jeffrey goldberg asked  what do you think motivates iran   to which mccain replied hatred i don t try to divine people s motives i look at their actions and what they say i don t pretend to be an expert on the state of their emotions i do know what their nation s stated purpose is i do know they continue in the development of nuclear weapons and i know that they continue to support terrorists who are bent on the destruction of the state of israel you ll have to ask someone who engages in this psycho stuff to talk about their emotions mccain s views on iraq were even more disturbing essentially surmising that the invasion and occupation was a good thing and that we shouldn t have left because  leaving iraq gave rise to al qaeda  ok admittedly it s a bit counter intuitive but it works for neoconservativesthese statements by mccain and graham are not admissions made by normal welladjusted individuals but rather by cold dark hearted sociopaths who generally view the lives of arabs along with slavs russians and others as necessary cannon fodder in the pursuit of military industrial profits for a select cadr  of transnational corporate  defense  contractors   whose interests senator john mccain represents in his home state of arizona boeing raytheon lockheed martin general dynamics and the list goes on and onthe geopolitical hubris doesn t end there as mccain still maintains   even after 6 years of absolute implosion of his own foreign policy agenda   that removing syrian president bashar al assad from power is still a  key pillar  of the us strategy for syria the administration has yet to articulate its vision for syria beyond the defeat of isil let alone a comprehensive approach to the middle east  said mccain this weekthe reality of course is that isilisis could have been defeated already had the usled  coalition  and israel not illegally intervened in syria territory far from doing much to  defeat isis  since they have invaded syrian airspace since 2014 the us has conveniently stretchedout the  isis problem  through the extension of its own selfstyled international mandate which was originally intended to serve as a precursor to the eventual breakup of syria into federal states and ethnic cantons this might explain mccain s rush to enact regime change in syria before lording over the eventual breakup of the sovereign nationstateall things russianthe other country which mccain is determined break is russia vladimir putin is a murder and a kgb thug  crowed mccain on cnn last year as he protested against positive statements about russia made by then candidate trumpsuffice to say he along with the boards of boeing raytheon lockheed martin are all extremely happy about nato pressing right up against the russian border in eastern europebut 2013 was indeed a busy year for the senator stirring up trouble internationally as part of his opening gambit against moscow it was mccain who was the driving force behind the usbacked coup d etat in ukraine in february 2014   which ultimately led to a bloody civil war which continues to this day in the ukraine apparently this was mccain s way of  stopping putin his is a very dodgy track record whether it s neonazis or jihadi terrorists mccain seems always ready to do a deal with the devil and that s what makes him particularly dangerousbelow we can see mccain helping to whipup nazilinked neofascist street mobs in kiev helping to bring the ensuing junta into power some mainstream us pundits have claimed that this never happened and that it s just a conspiracy theory invented

even suggested d tente with russia or that supplying lethal arms to militants in syria was a bad idea it s no surprise that cognizant onlookers have questioned whether or not mccain is in a normal frame of mindfrankly speaking how could any one in their right mind be so consistently on the wrong side of every issue how could any politician s judgement be that poor unless there was something else going on below the surface the questions didn t stop there mccain s performance during a recent senate intelligence committee hearing on  russian influence in us elections  was an embarrassment onlookers were stunned when mccain lost the plot during the hearing when asking former fbi director james comey well at least in the minds of this member there s a whole lot of questions remaining about what went on particularly considering the fact that as you mentioned it s a  big deal  as to what went on during the campaign so i m glad you concluded that part of the investigation but i think that the american people have a whole lot of questions out there particularly since you just emphasized the role that russia played and obviously she was a candidate for president at the time so she was clearly involved in this whole situation where fake news as you just described it is a big deal took place you re going to have to help me out here in other words we re complete the investigation of anything former secretary clinton had to do with the campaign is over and we don t have to worry about it anymore  to which comey replied with respect to   i m a little confused with respect to secretary clinton we investigated a criminal investigation with her use of a personal email server mccain then finished digging his own hole by responding so at the same time you made the announcement there would be no further charges brought against thensecretary clinton for any activities involved in the russia involvement and our engagement and our election i don t quite understand how you can be done with that but not done with the whole investigation of their attempt to affect the out of come our election it was clear mccain had no idea what was going on at that point any reasonable person would have concluded that john mccain had in fact lost his mind   and was no longer fit to serve in public office  in fact 21wire made this very same case back in 2013 after mccain was caught playing video poker on his iphone during a senate committee where lawmakers were debating the very war of which he is a chief architect here is the photoas stunning displays of ignorance go the video poker incident was one of mccain s greatest ever and certainly should have been a warning to everyone that this man had no business making military decisions let alone litigating war and peace between nuclear superpowers like the united states and russiaperhaps an announcement is forthcoming but it s surprising after being diagnosed with brain cancer at 80 years old   why mccain has not yet announced his resignation from officeit s fair to say that while this senator is being treated in the world s leading medical facilities thousands of innocents will have died needlessly because of us sanctions and support for terrorists   all in the name of defense energy and ever vast corporate profits strange as that might sound to some for those who consider themselves members of a ruling elite and its mandarin management class that is perfectly acceptable quid pro quo in 2017after world war ii the military industrial complex and the international arms trade has spread conflict like a disease across the planet metastasizing in ways in places and on a scale which no one could have previously imagined before undoubtedly over the last decade john mccain has played a key role in spreading that anguish for the people of syria afghanistan and the ukraine that will be his legacy not the chimerical image of a  maverick  senator or the  war hero once again we implore the senator

seat parliament thanks to a deal with a small northern irish party  a rebellion of seven or more conservative lawmakers could see her lose a vote in parliament and forced into making concessions the objections are mainly based on two themes 1 the power for the government to amend eu laws as they are brought onto the british statute book these are often referred to as  henry viii  powers after the 16th century english monarch who ruled by proclamation the government says it needs to be able to fix the wording of laws to ensure they work correctly after brexit for example where a law refers to an eu institution which will no longer have jurisdiction in britain the law must be changed to point to the correct british equivalent  critics say the bill gives ministers too much power to make changes and creates the potential for policy shifts to be implemented without full parliamentary scrutiny the process through which the government would make the changes already exists and is known as  secondary legislation  it does allow for some degree of scrutiny by lawmakers but would not submit changes to the full legislative process  2 the bill does not contain a provision for parliament to vote on the final brexit deal the government has promised lawmakers they will get a  meaningful vote  on the outcome of negotiations in brussels to decide the terms of britain s exit and its future relationship with the bloc as it currently stands this vote will be on whether to accept the terms of the deal or reject it and walk away without a deal but critics says the promise of a vote should be written into the bill some also say that it should give lawmakers more options than the current  take it or leave it  vote this could mean an option to send britain back to the negotiating table what has happened so far the bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle in september when after two days of debate lawmakers voted 326 to 290 in favor of the principles of the bill  although the government won the vote several conservatives indicated they were unhappy with the details of it and said they wanted to see concessions during the next stage  what happens next the first two days of the  committee stage  have been scheduled for tuesday and wednesday but the remaining six days have not yet been scheduled  any lawmaker can submit changes for consideration so far 186 pages of socalled  amendments  have been submitted the list will be scrutinized by parliament s deputy speaker whittled down and grouped according to subject the amendments to be considered will be announced at the start of each day s debate the first two days will focus on the part of the bill that repeals the 1972 european communities act the retention conversion and interpretation of existing eu laws and eu rights   at the end of the debate over each group of amendments some will be put to a vote if supported by a majority of lawmakers the changes will be made to the bill they can still be reversed once all the groups of amendments have been debated the bill is reprinted to include any amendments passed and it moves on to the next stage in the process which is  the bill will be subject to several more stages of votes in the lower chamber and the upper chamber of parliament the entire process will take months to complete and there is no target end date report stage  any amendments voted by the house at committee stage will pass to report stage this is a new opportunity to add amendments the speaker of the house oversees this process third reading  this takes place immediately after report stage it usually lasts an hour and is a general discussion of the bill followed by a vote no amendments can be made house of lords  the bill passes to the unelected upper chamber of parliament the house of lords lords can put forward their own amendments each of which will be discussed and decided on in turn if the lords agree to any amendments the bill passes back to the house of commons for its approval ping pong if the bill passes back to the commons they debate and vote on the lords  amendments no new amendments can be introduced in theory the bill can continue passing back and forth between the lords and commons until the final bill is agreed upon royal assent once the bill has been agreed by both houses of parliament it is given royal assent when the queen formally agrees to make the bill into an act of parliament ,Factual News

shaping of the way some countries receive military aid from the united states foreign military financing gives countries loans or grants to buy us military equipment the state department decides which countries are given the financing while the pentagon executes the decisions under the trump proposal many current grants would instead be converted to loans we do change a couple of the foreign military programs from direct grants to loans said mick mulvaney the director of the white house office of management and budget in a briefing with reporters on monday our argument was instead of  giving somebody 100 million we could give them a smaller number worth of loan guarantees and they could actually buy more stuff military aid to israel and egypt two close us allies in the middle east and the biggest recipients of us military assistance will remain unchanged mulvaney said the wall street journal which first reported the proposal said the foreign military grants could affect pakistan tunisia lebanon ukraine colombia the philippines and vietnam us military assistance to partners and allies reached 135 billion in 2015 or 28 percent of all us foreign aid spending that year according to the congressional research service most grants through the foreign military financing fmf program go to israel egypt jordan pakistan and iraq congress ultimately controls the government purse strings and may reject some or many of the trump administrations proposals republicans and democrats in congress have criticized the size of the cuts to the state department and us agency for international development mulvaney said that aid to pakistan would be reduced though he did not give concrete details the state department still has some flexibility to come up with a final plan on that but i do know that writ large we have proposed to move several countries from a direct grant program to a loan guarantee program he said todd harrison a defense budget analyst with the center for strategic and budgetary assessments said the switch from grants to loans for military aid may mean that countries will not be able to afford us military equipment forcing them to go elsewhere for supplies countries can buy from china or russia they have other places to shop and one of the ways that we build capacity with our partners is through these grants harrison said its in our interest to have interoperability with our allies and these military grants are a part of that thomas spoehr who directs the center for national defense at the conservative heritage foundation said the conversion from grants to loans will be a challenge especially for smaller military aid recipient countries like macedonia and tunisia     but its a proposal whose time has come spoehr said given us budget deficits and high military spending overall     this is probably a prudent place to make some cuts given all the other investments we make in national defense spoehr said  ,Factual News
